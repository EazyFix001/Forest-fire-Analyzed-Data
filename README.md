# Forest-fire-Analyzed-Data
Summary
Exploring the relationships between weather conditions, spatial factors, and fire risk in the Montesinho natural park using the UCI Forest Fires dataset.

Objectives
1. Predict the likelihood of forest fires based on weather and spatial factors to inform proactive management strategies.
2. Analyze the relationships between weather conditions and fire severity to develop effective fire mitigation plans.
3. Identify high-risk areas prone to forest fires to prioritize resource allocation and prevention efforts.
4. Understand how fire behavior indices relate to weather conditions to improve fire prediction and management.
5. Inform evidence-based fire prevention strategies by identifying key factors contributing to forest fires.

Data Source
The dataset was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repositoryâ€“ (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires) It consists of the following coluwmns;

X (spatial coordinate)
Y (spatial coordinate)
month
day
FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code)
DMC (Duff Moisture Code)
DC (Drought Code)
ISI (Initial Spread Index)
temp (temperature)
RH (relative humidity)
wind
rain
area (burned area)

Methodology and Tools
Excel: Data cleaning and pre-processing were carried out at the initial stage to ensure data quality; Data loading and inspection, Correcting data type, Creating additional numeric columns, Data cleaning and formatting.
SQL Server: An Exploratory Data Analysis was performed using SQL;
1. What locations have the highest propensity to experience forest fires?
2. What locations actually experienced forest fires?
3. What season is forest fires most likely to occur?
4. What month has the largest burnt area by forest fires?
Power BI: Data Visualization.

Analysis & Key Findings
1. The results show that several locations experienced forest fires, with the most severe fires occurring in areas with high FFMC values and dry conditions.
2. The analysis reveals that summer is the season with the highest total area burned and total FFMC values, indicating a higher likelihood of forest fires during this time.
3. The results also showed that August has the largest burnt area, followed closely by July and September, indicating a peak fire season during these months.
4. The locations with the highest FFMC values indicates a high propensity for forest fires. These locations are primarily situated in areas with dry conditions and high temperatures.

Recommendations
1. Focus prevention efforts on locations with high FFMC values and dry conditions, particularly during peak fire season (summer months).
2. Implement enhanced monitoring and surveillance in high-risk areas, especially during August, July, and September.
3. Create firebreaks in areas with high fire risk to contain potential fires and reduce the spread of forest fires.
4. Educate the public on forest fire risks and prevention strategies.
